   git clone https://github.com/valoudefou/flight-searcher.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:

### Preview the App on Your Mobile Phone
This app is built with Expo, which makes it easy to preview your React Native app on Android and iOS devices.

1. Install the Expo Go app on your mobile phone:
   - [Expo Go for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - [Expo Go for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. Start the Expo server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and show a QR code in the terminal or the Expo Developer Tools in your browser.

3. Scan the QR code:
   - For Android: Open Expo Go and scan the QR code from your terminal or browser.
   - For iOS: Use the camera app to scan the QR code and tap the link to open it in Expo Go.

Now you can see the app live on your mobile device!
